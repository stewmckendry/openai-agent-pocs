**Title:** AI Agents: Beyond the Buzzword — What They Are, Why They Matter, and How to Build Them Responsibly

---

### Everyone’s Talking About Agents. But Can They Really Help?

AI agents are quickly becoming part of mainstream business strategy. According to recent surveys, over half of companies already run agents in production, and nearly 80% are actively developing new ones.

And yet, the term "AI agent" remains loosely defined. Most people still encounter AI as basic copilots or chat interfaces—like using ChatGPT to draft a document or Microsoft Copilot to summarize a Teams call. These tools provide real productivity value but are only the starting point.

We’re just beginning to unlock what’s possible when AI agents take on more responsibility and autonomy. There’s a clear continuum emerging:

* **Small tasks** (like extracting data from a file)
* → **Persistent roles** (like an AI planner or researcher)
* → **Chained processes** (like onboarding or trip planning)
* → **Functional agents** managing entire workflows across systems

This trend underpins the mission that Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke described in a memo: teams will need to demonstrate why new roles can't be handled by AI before asking for headcount or budget. That mindset is spreading—and may become the norm faster than we think.

That leaves leaders with important strategic questions:

1. *What are the real capabilities AI agents can provide—and how do we take best advantage of them for our business, customers, and people?*
2. *What does my organization need to look like to support this? What infrastructure—technical, data, governance—makes this sustainable?*
3. *How do we go beyond pilots and experiments to scale these systems responsibly? Do we centralize efforts—or empower teams across the organization?*

👉 This post shares three practical applications of AI agents to show what’s already possible—how they’re built, how they work, and how they can support real-world use cases both for individuals and organizations.

### From Custom GPTs to AI Agent Teams

In earlier CoachingTheMachine posts, I shared projects like **ConcussionGPT** (for youth sports safety), **GovDoc Copilot** (for public sector writing), and **MyHealth AI Assistant** (for exploring your own health data). These were helpful single-agent tools built with ChatGPT, often enhanced with retrieval or templates—but limited to one model and one interface, with little flexibility or visibility into how they worked.

Now, with frameworks like the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, we can go much further.

These tools let us build teams of AI agents that work together—each with its own job, memory, and tools. The SDK gives you a simple but robust platform to build agents without reinventing the wheel. It comes ready-to-use with:

* **Agents** – LLMs equipped with specific instructions and tools
* **Handoffs** – the ability to delegate tasks to other agents in a chain
* **Guardrails** – safeguards to check inputs before agents act
* **Headless design** – deploy agents through any frontend (e.g. Streamlit, Slack, custom apps)
* **Model and provider flexibility** – switch between GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, or others as needed
* **MCP support** – a new open standard that lets AI agents interact with files, tools, and context like a developer would
* **Built-in trace + visualization** – to debug, iterate, and improve your flows

In the rest of this post, I’ll walk through **three working examples**, each tailored to a different kind of use case—some consumer-facing, some built for project or product teams inside organizations. They’re not meant to be exclusive patterns, but rather to spark ideas and show what’s now possible.&#x20;

### Three Real Agent Teams in Action

#### 🏅 Run Coach Agent: Train Smarter With Your Data

Imagine this: you’ve been logging runs with your Garmin, and now you want to train for a sub-20 minute 5K in two months. You type:

> "Run a 4:00 per km pace 5K in 2 months."

Behind the scenes, the agent team kicks in:

1. **Goal Agent** parses your race target: distance, pace, and date.
2. **Collect Agent** loads recent workouts from your `Activities.csv`.
3. **Analyze Agent** identifies your training strengths and gaps.
4. **Plan Agent** creates a week-by-week schedule tailored to your goal.
5. **Check Agent** reviews the plan for safety, realism, and completeness.

The result? A full 8-week training plan with long runs, speed work, hill repeats, and race taper guidance. All saved as Markdown, with a workflow diagram to show exactly how the plan was built.

Why it matters:

* Makes coaching logic accessible to anyone.
* Shows how agents can interpret personal data, reason across roles, and produce helpful, human-friendly outputs.
* Designed with responsibility: guards against unrealistic inputs and prioritizes safe planning.

#### ✈️ Trip Planner Agent: From Dream to Itinerary

Prompt:

> "I want to take my son on an NHL road trip next season."

Sounds fun. But vague. Where? When? What games? What logistics?

Here’s how the agent team handled it:

1. **Topic Agent** extracted research goals: season start date, best cities, transport, family-friendly hotels, special NHL events.
2. **Research Agent** searched the web for each topic and summarized the findings.
3. **Planner Agent** wrote a day-by-day itinerary: Chicago to Toronto to Boston to Miami to Tampa to New York to Philly.

Each segment had:

* Travel recommendations
* Family-friendly hotels near arenas
* Games to attend
* Side activities like museums and markets

Why it matters:

* Turns vague intentions into structured, actionable plans.
* Shows agents collaborating with real-time search and summarization.
* Offers a glimpse into what agent-powered travel assistants could be.

#### 🛠️ User Story Agent: From Idea to Implementation

Prompt:

> "Search for dog walkers in my area."

The result?

A **ready-to-develop user story**, including:

* UX spec with personas and journeys
* Functional and technical specs
* Acceptance criteria
* Impact analysis
* Effort estimate

How?
The agent team handled the entire flow:

1. **UX Agent** outlined personas and user flows.
2. **Functional Agent** defined features: search, filters, profiles, booking.
3. **Technical Agent** translated features into APIs, DB tables, components.
4. **Acceptance Agent** wrote Gherkin-style criteria.
5. **Impact Agent** assessed code and doc changes.
6. **Estimation Agent** assigned story points.
7. **Writer Agent** compiled the full spec.
8. **Verifier Agent** checked it met the Definition of Ready.

Why it matters:

* Shows how agents can simulate team-based design and planning work.
* Greatly accelerates requirements generation for delivery teams.
* Produces structured, reviewable artifacts you can trace.

### How It Works (And Why That Matters)

These agents weren’t coded line-by-line. They were scaffolded using:

* **Codex Agents**: I typed what I wanted; the agents scaffolded code for me.
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: a reusable file system that agents can access safely. Think of it as a shared drive *the AI understands*.
* **Model switching**: While this uses OpenAI’s SDK, I can swap in Gemini, Claude, or others depending on task, preference, or platform.

This isn’t about one model. It’s about a *pattern* for working with AI.

### Reflections: What This Means for You

#### 💼 For Organizations

* You don’t need to wait for an "AI platform" to get started.
* What you do need:

  * Tools and infra to run agentic workflows
  * **A sandbox** where people can explore safely
  * Light governance: security, traceability, and human-in-the-loop design
* The real magic? Empower your people to iterate on *real use cases*. That’s where the impact is.

#### 🤖 For Individuals (Worried About AI Taking Your Job)

* The best way to prepare is to **build something**.
* Don’t fear the code. Use Codex. Copy a POC. Try a tutorial.
* Understanding agents means understanding how decisions get made.

#### 👨‍🎓 For Parents (Like Me)

* I have an 8-year-old son. I don’t just think about the job he’ll have.
* I think about the *team* he’ll lead.
* The future belongs to those who:

  * Understand a domain deeply
  * Can collaborate with tools and people
  * Are curious, creative, and responsible

Teaching our kids to explore, build, and reflect is the best gift we can give them.

### Final Word: It’s Time to Coach the Agents

AI agents aren’t coming. They’re already here.

But the future isn’t about replacing people. It’s about building *teams of humans and AI* that learn, adapt, and do good work together.

That’s what CoachingTheMachine is all about. Let’s keep going.
