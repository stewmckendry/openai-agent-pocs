**Title:** AI Agents: Beyond the Buzzword — What They Are, Why They Matter, and How to Build Them Responsibly

---

### Everyone’s Talking About Agents. But Can They Really Help?

AI agents are moving from hype into mission-critical systems across sectors. Consider:

• According to the 2025 "State of AI Agents" survey by LangChain, **51% of companies** are already running AI agents in production, and **78% are currently developing new agents** ([langchain.com](https://www.langchain.com/stateofaiagents?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

• In a survey from Salesforce, **78% of C-suite leaders** say their organizations are already using AI agents, viewing “digital labor” as a strategic advantage ([salesforceben.com](https://www.salesforceben.com/78-of-leaders-report-their-companies-are-using-ai-agents-the-latest-salesforce-stats/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

• The global AI agent market is projected to grow from **\$3.7 billion in 2023 to over \$100 billion by 2032** ([warmly.ai](https://www.warmly.ai/p/blog/ai-agents-statistics?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Even though these numbers are high, the term "AI agent" remains loosely defined. Many people are still wrapping their heads around how to use these technologies securely and responsibly—especially as the market moves fast and the hype cycle accelerates.

Today, most of us interact with AI as copilots or assistants—whether using ChatGPT to brainstorm a document or leveraging Microsoft Copilot inside Teams or Word. These tools offer valuable productivity gains.

But we’re only beginning to scratch the surface of what’s possible when AI agents take on:

* **Routine tasks** (e.g. analyzing files, summarizing logs)
* **Defined roles** (e.g. a planner, a researcher, a designer)
* **Coordinated functions** (e.g. generating plans, taking actions, and verifying results)

While early signs are promising, there’s still an *abundance of marketing* and a *shortage of proven agent systems operating at scale*.

That leaves leaders with important strategic questions:

1. *What are the real capabilities AI agents can provide—and how do we take best advantage of them for our business, customers, and people?*
2. *What does my organization need to look like to support this? What infrastructure—technical, data, governance—makes this sustainable?*
3. *How do we go beyond pilots and experiments to scale these systems responsibly? Do we centralize efforts—or empower teams across the organization?*

👉 This post doesn’t answer every question. But it does share three practical applications of AI agents, built to showcase what these systems can actually do for both individuals and organizations. You'll see how they were built, what they enable, what to think about as you roll them out—whether for experimentation or scaled adoption—and hopefully get inspired to start building too.

### From Custom GPTs to Real AI Agent Teams

In earlier CoachingTheMachine posts, I shared projects like:

* **ConcussionGPT**, a custom assistant for sports safety;
* **GovDoc Copilot**, a copilot for writing public sector submissions;
* **MyHealth AI Assistant**, a conversational tool to explore your own health data.

These were helpful copilots—conversational interfaces to a single LLM, often enhanced with retrieval tools or structured templates. But they were still solo players.

This next wave is different. With the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python), we can now build **teams of agents**, each with a defined role, tools, and memory—working together through structured handoffs.

The SDK is designed to be lightweight, Python-friendly, and transparent. You work directly with core primitives:

* **Agents**, which are LLMs equipped with tools and instructions
* **Handoffs**, which allow agents to delegate specific tasks to other agents
* **Guardrails**, which validate input and enforce preconditions before processing

It’s simple enough to use without a steep learning curve, yet powerful enough to express complex workflows. You can also trace, debug, visualize, and fine-tune the flows.

In the rest of this post, I’ll walk through **three working examples**, each built using this SDK:

* 🏅 **Run Coach Agent**: generates a tailored training plan from your running data and race goal
* ✈️ **Trip Planner Agent**: assembles a day-by-day itinerary from a single sentence
* 🛠️ **User Story Agent**: transforms a vague idea into a developer-ready user story

Each one is built around a real-world use case and shows how agents can collaborate, reason, and deliver structured, traceable results. And each one was built not with manual coding, but with Codex-powered tools and reusable context from a shared AI-friendly file system (MCP).

Let’s see what they can do.

### Three Real Agent Teams in Action

#### 🏅 Run Coach Agent: Train Smarter With Your Data

Imagine this: you’ve been logging runs with your Garmin, and now you want to train for a sub-20 minute 5K in two months. You type:

> "Run a 4:00 per km pace 5K in 2 months."

Behind the scenes, the agent team kicks in:

1. **Goal Agent** parses your race target: distance, pace, and date.
2. **Collect Agent** loads recent workouts from your `Activities.csv`.
3. **Analyze Agent** identifies your training strengths and gaps.
4. **Plan Agent** creates a week-by-week schedule tailored to your goal.
5. **Check Agent** reviews the plan for safety, realism, and completeness.

The result? A full 8-week training plan with long runs, speed work, hill repeats, and race taper guidance. All saved as Markdown, with a workflow diagram to show exactly how the plan was built.

Why it matters:

* Makes coaching logic accessible to anyone.
* Shows how agents can interpret personal data, reason across roles, and produce helpful, human-friendly outputs.
* Designed with responsibility: guards against unrealistic inputs and prioritizes safe planning.

#### ✈️ Trip Planner Agent: From Dream to Itinerary

Prompt:

> "I want to take my son on an NHL road trip next season."

Sounds fun. But vague. Where? When? What games? What logistics?

Here’s how the agent team handled it:

1. **Topic Agent** extracted research goals: season start date, best cities, transport, family-friendly hotels, special NHL events.
2. **Research Agent** searched the web for each topic and summarized the findings.
3. **Planner Agent** wrote a day-by-day itinerary: Chicago to Toronto to Boston to Miami to Tampa to New York to Philly.

Each segment had:

* Travel recommendations
* Family-friendly hotels near arenas
* Games to attend
* Side activities like museums and markets

Why it matters:

* Turns vague intentions into structured, actionable plans.
* Shows agents collaborating with real-time search and summarization.
* Offers a glimpse into what agent-powered travel assistants could be.

#### 🛠️ User Story Agent: From Idea to Implementation

Prompt:

> "Search for dog walkers in my area."

The result?

A **ready-to-develop user story**, including:

* UX spec with personas and journeys
* Functional and technical specs
* Acceptance criteria
* Impact analysis
* Effort estimate

How?
The agent team handled the entire flow:

1. **UX Agent** outlined personas and user flows.
2. **Functional Agent** defined features: search, filters, profiles, booking.
3. **Technical Agent** translated features into APIs, DB tables, components.
4. **Acceptance Agent** wrote Gherkin-style criteria.
5. **Impact Agent** assessed code and doc changes.
6. **Estimation Agent** assigned story points.
7. **Writer Agent** compiled the full spec.
8. **Verifier Agent** checked it met the Definition of Ready.

Why it matters:

* Shows how agents can simulate team-based design and planning work.
* Greatly accelerates requirements generation for delivery teams.
* Produces structured, reviewable artifacts you can trace.

### How It Works (And Why That Matters)

These agents weren’t coded line-by-line. They were scaffolded using:

* **Codex Agents**: I typed what I wanted; the agents scaffolded code for me.
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: a reusable file system that agents can access safely. Think of it as a shared drive *the AI understands*.
* **Model switching**: While this uses OpenAI’s SDK, I can swap in Gemini, Claude, or others depending on task, preference, or platform.

This isn’t about one model. It’s about a *pattern* for working with AI.

### Reflections: What This Means for You

#### 💼 For Organizations

* You don’t need to wait for an "AI platform" to get started.
* What you do need:

  * Tools and infra to run agentic workflows
  * **A sandbox** where people can explore safely
  * Light governance: security, traceability, and human-in-the-loop design
* The real magic? Empower your people to iterate on *real use cases*. That’s where the impact is.

#### 🤖 For Individuals (Worried About AI Taking Your Job)

* The best way to prepare is to **build something**.
* Don’t fear the code. Use Codex. Copy a POC. Try a tutorial.
* Understanding agents means understanding how decisions get made.

#### 👨‍🎓 For Parents (Like Me)

* I have an 8-year-old son. I don’t just think about the job he’ll have.
* I think about the *team* he’ll lead.
* The future belongs to those who:

  * Understand a domain deeply
  * Can collaborate with tools and people
  * Are curious, creative, and responsible

Teaching our kids to explore, build, and reflect is the best gift we can give them.

### Final Word: It’s Time to Coach the Agents

AI agents aren’t coming. They’re already here.

But the future isn’t about replacing people. It’s about building *teams of humans and AI* that learn, adapt, and do good work together.

That’s what CoachingTheMachine is all about. Let’s keep going.
