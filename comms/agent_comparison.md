- Good for user-facing copilots and content generation

**Limitations**
- Less control over flow logic, agent state, or reasoning steps
- No native multi-agent orchestration
- Can't customize UI/UX deeply
- Deployment tied to OpenAI's platform

**Best For**
- Domain-specific GPTs (e.g., PolicyCopilot, HelpdeskBot)
- Lightweight tools with web/public access
- Non-devs or mixed teams needing powerful LLMs quickly

## 🧠 3. Google AI Studio  
[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

**Overview**  
Web-based IDE for prototyping with Gemini models. Offers prompt templates, grounding with documents, and API export to Vertex AI.

**Key Features**
- Rapid prototyping with Gemini
- Grounding with uploaded files
- Code export to Python/Colab
- Part of the Google Cloud AI toolchain
- Teams and org sharing via Google Workspace

**Benefits**
- Tight integration with Google Cloud
- Easy onboarding for orgs already using Google
- Simplified access to Gemini’s multimodal models
- Good RAG + tool calling support

**Limitations**
- No multi-agent orchestration or autonomous behaviors
- Primarily for single-turn or prompt-based flows
- Limited extensibility outside Google ecosystem

**Best For**
- Prompt engineers or analysts testing Gemini
- Teams on Google Cloud building document-based workflows
- Exporting to production via Vertex AI

---

## 🧭 4. Microsoft Copilot Studio  
[Copilot Studio (formerly Power Virtual Agents)](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/)

**Overview**  
No-code/low-code environment to build chat-based copilots in Microsoft 365 ecosystem (Teams, Word, Excel, Dynamics).

**Key Features**
- Visual flow builder for dialogs and actions
- Grounding via Dataverse, SharePoint, OneDrive, custom plugins
- Connect to APIs and Power Automate
- Deploy to Teams, web chat, or custom channels
- Integrates with Azure OpenAI + internal data

**Benefits**
- Deep enterprise integration (MS Graph, Outlook, Teams, etc.)
- Good for governed environments (compliance, access controls)
- Tool-rich: combines chatbot logic, flows, RAG, external APIs
- Works well for internal copilots in large organizations

**Limitations**
- Less suited to developer-led, code-based agent workflows
- Harder to customize orchestration logic or fine-grained control
- Tooling feels like “bot-first” rather than “agent-native”

**Best For**
- Enterprise copilots within Microsoft stack (e.g., HR, IT, Finance bots)
- Low-code teams building tools for Teams/Office 365
- Organizations prioritizing security, governance, and compliance
