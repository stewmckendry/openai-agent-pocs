## Task 101f: Prepare Testing and Documentation for User Story Agents (PoC 1)

Enhance code quality, reproducibility, and usability by documenting all components, setting up test instructions, and ensuring ready-to-run outputs.

---

### ðŸ§  Context
Once Task 101e completes the SDK refactor, this task ensures the system is easy to test, run, and understand.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Add documentation headers to all code and script files
- Provide sample test input and CLI commands
- Validate CLI tool works end-to-end with expected output
- Document how to run and deploy locally

---

### ðŸ“‹ Instructions for Codex Agent

#### 1. **Header Comments for Code Files**
- Every `*.py` file in `agents/`, `tools/`, and `scripts/` must include:
  ```python
  """
  Purpose: [Brief summary of what the file/agent/tool does]
  Usage: Imported by agent runner or CLI
  Deployment: Used in CLI or hosted apps (e.g. Streamlit, Railway)
  Run: See `scripts/generate_user_stories.py`
  """
  ```

#### 2. **Script Comments (e.g. generate_user_stories.py)**
- CLI scripts must include:
  ```python
  """
  CLI for generating user stories from a feature idea
  Run:
    python scripts/generate_user_stories.py
  Or:
    poetry run python scripts/generate_user_stories.py
  Deployment:
    Streamlit/Gradio UI (optional), or Railway CLI
  Requirements:
    - Python 3.11+
    - `openai-agents[viz]`
    - Set OPENAI_API_KEY
  """
  ```

#### 3. **Test Data Setup**
- Add `data/sample_input.txt` with example feature:
  ```
  As a user, I want to upload a CSV of customer contacts to the CRM
  ```
- Add `expected_output_schema.yaml` (optional)

#### 4. **Test Instructions**
- Update `README.md` or `scripts/generate_user_stories.py` with:
  ```bash
  python scripts/generate_user_stories.py "As a user..."
  open outputs/stories.json
  open outputs/trace_graph.html
  ```

---

### âœ… Output
- Header comments added
- CLI script documented
- Data file added
- Trace and result rendered end-to-end
- Developer can test PoC by following one command

This task improves onboarding, testability, and developer experience for downstream agents or blog demo.
