The NHL has announced that the 2025-26 regular season will commence on October 7, 2025. ([sportsnet.ca](https://www.sportsnet.ca/article/nhl-announces-start-date-for-2025-26-season/?utm_source=openai)) While the full schedule has not been released yet, it is typically unveiled in late June or early July. For instance, the 2024-25 schedule was released on July 2, 2024. ([nhl.com](https://www.nhl.com/hurricanes/news/key-2025-offseason-events-times?utm_source=openai)) Therefore, you can expect the 2025-26 schedule to be available around the same timeframe, allowing you to plan your visits to multiple cities for NHL games accordingly.

Traveling between cities in the U.S. and Canada to attend NHL games offers several transportation options, each with varying costs. Air travel is the fastest method, with round-trip flights from major U.S. cities to Canadian destinations like Toronto or Vancouver typically ranging from $300 to $600. Booking flights well in advance and choosing off-peak seasons can help reduce expenses. Budget airlines may offer additional savings, though amenities might be limited.

Driving is a cost-effective alternative, especially for shorter distances or when traveling in groups. For instance, a road trip from New York City to Toronto, approximately 500 miles, would require about 20 gallons of gas, totaling around $70 at an average fuel price of $3.50 per gallon. Additional costs such as tolls and potential overnight accommodations should also be considered. ([urbansurvivalhub.com](https://urbansurvivalhub.com/how-much-is-a-trip-to-canada/?utm_source=openai))

Public transportation options like buses and trains are available for certain routes. Services such as Greyhound offer routes from many U.S. cities to Canadian destinations, with prices generally ranging from $50 to $150 each way. Train travel via Amtrak is another viable option, particularly for scenic routes such as the Adirondack line from New York City to Montreal, which costs around $100 one way.

For fans seeking a comprehensive experience, specialized travel packages are available. Companies like Elite Sports Tours offer NHL travel packages that include game tickets, hotel accommodations near arenas, and optional flights. These packages can be customized to fit individual preferences and budgets, providing a seamless way to enjoy multiple games across different cities. ([elitesportstours.com](https://www.elitesportstours.com/events/nhl?utm_source=openai))

When planning your trip, it's essential to account for additional expenses such as accommodation, local transportation, and game-related costs. For example, attending an Edmonton Oilers game in Dallas could involve ticket prices around $283 CAD, with a three-night stay costing approximately $650 CAD, bringing the total to about $930 CAD. ([edmonton.ctvnews.ca](https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/here-s-how-much-it-would-cost-an-oilers-fan-to-catch-saturday-s-nhl-game-in-dallas-1.6898249?utm_source=openai))

In summary, the best transportation option depends on factors like distance, budget, and personal preferences. Air travel offers speed but at a higher cost, while driving and public transportation can be more economical for shorter distances. Comprehensive travel packages provide convenience for those looking to attend multiple games.
