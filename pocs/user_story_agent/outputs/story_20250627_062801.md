# Impact Assessment
**Code Impact:**
1. **User Authentication**: The current code base ("existing_login" module) will need significant updates to include JWT token authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and potentially support both email/password and OAuth-based logins as indicated in the backlog and as required by the specification.

2. **Location-Based Search and Map Integration**: New components and services for using the Geolocation API and integration with Google Maps API will need to be developed from scratch on both frontend and backend side.

3. **UI Enhancements for Filters, Sorting, and Profiles**: The existing React interface will require additional components for filtering and sorting interfaces, detailed walker profiles, and availability calendars, with backend supporting for these queries.

4. **Booking and Notification System**: Assuming the notification system will be refactored as noted in the backlog, integrating booking and scheduling logic with notifications will require new modules in both the frontend and backend.

5. **Rating & Review Systems**: New backend endpoints and frontend forms alongside the processing logic (potentially using background tasks) needs to be established.

6. **Security Enhancements**: Introducing HTTPS, JWT, bcrypt, and regular vulnerability assessments must be new facets in the project's architecture.

7. **Payment and Rewards Implementation**: Payment processing components are to be integrated with front-end and back-end services with potential usage of APIs like Stripe.

**Documentation Impact:**
1. Design documentation and technical architecture documents must be updated to reflect JWT-based authentication flow, map service integration, and payment gateway.

2. New user manuals and interface guides should be created or updated to include new UI/UX features related to map, bookings, and payment.

3. Security design documentation should be expanded to include notes on encryption, data privacy, and security audit protocols.

4. Updated backlog reflects the need for OAuth support and refactoring tasks related to notifications, all requiring their respective analysis and expanded documentation.
