# Technical Spec
### Technical Specification for Lookup Pizza Locations

#### Components

1. **Frontend (React with TypeScript)**
   - **Search Bar Component**: For entering location queries.
   - **Map Component**: Integrated with services like Google Maps API to display pizza shop locations.
   - **List View Component**: Displays a list of pizza shops.
   - **Detail View Component**: Provides detailed information about selected shops.
   - **Filter & Sort Component**: Allows filtering and sorting of shop results.
   - **Favorites Management**: Enables users to mark and view favorite shops.

2. **Backend (Python with FastAPI)**
   - **Endpoints**:
     - `/search` for handling location-based search queries.
     - `/details/{shop_id}` for retrieving detailed shop information.
     - `/reviews/{shop_id}` for accessing user reviews and ratings.
     - `/favorites` for managing user favorites.
   - **Business Logic**:
     - Integration with external map services (e.g., Google Maps API) for map rendering.
     - Coordinate with external review and rating systems if needed.
     - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data such as popular shop locations.

3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**
   - **Schemas/Tables**:
     - `shops`: Stores information about pizza shops.
     - `reviews`: Manages user reviews and ratings.
     - `favorites`: Keeps track of user’s favorite shops.
     - Ensure indexes on commonly searched fields (e.g., location coordinates).

4. **Caching and Background Tasks (Redis)**
   - Cache results of frequent queries for performance improvement.
   - Background syncing of shop data and reviews.

#### Data Flows

1. **Search Process**
   - User inputs a location -> Frontend sends request to `/search` -> Backend fetches relevant shop data -> Data is returned and displayed on the map and list views.

2. **Detail Retrieval**
   - User selects a shop -> Frontend requests details from `/details/{shop_id}` -> Backend retrieves details and responds to frontend.

3. **Filter and Sort**
   - User applies sort/filter settings -> Frontend adjusts the display based on backend's filtered data.

4. **Save and Retrieve Favorites**
   - User marks favorite -> Frontend sends request to `/favorites` -> Backend updates the database and confirms with frontend.

#### Key Implementation Notes

- **Security**: Ensure all API endpoints are secured with authentication and input validation.
- **Scalability**: Employ load balancing for frontend and backend services, and optimize database interactions.
- **User Experience**: Ensure responsiveness with mobile-first design; implement lazy loading for map markers and list items.
- **Compliance**: Use HTTPS for secure data transmission and follow data protection regulations where applicable.
