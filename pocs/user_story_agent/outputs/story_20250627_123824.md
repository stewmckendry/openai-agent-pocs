### Feedback
The user story has been improved by breaking down implementation into specific sprints with detailed tasks, addressing dependencies, and identifying constraints. However, the initial user story and goals section need to explicitly list functional and non-functional requirements and include detailed success and exit criteria in the acceptance criteria to better guide development and testing teams. Also, adding story-specific non-functional requirements like performance expectations could enhance readiness.

### Technical Spec
### Technical Specification

#### Overview:
The system comprises three primary features: Real-time Package Tracking, Courier Communication, and Package Holding at Post Office. These features will be integrated into an existing delivery application with a React front end and a FastAPI back end.

#### 1. Real-time Package Tracking
- **Components**:
  - **Frontend**: Utilizes React and a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet or Google Maps API) to display couriers' real-time locations.
  - **Backend**: A FastAPI service that interfaces with a GPS location provider API to fetch the latest courier locations.
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL tables to manage courier status and map-relevant data.
  - **Notifications**: Triggered events through FastAPI and delivered using web push notifications or in-app messaging.

- **Data Flows**:
  - Courier devices send location data to a GPS provider.
  - Backend service polls location data and updates the database.
  - Frontend queries backend endpoints to update the map and notifications in real-time.
  - Notifications sent when a package status changes to "Out for Delivery."

- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time data updates.
  - Leverage Redis to cache frequent GPS data requests for optimizing performance.

#### 2. Courier Communication
- **Components**:
  - **Frontend**: Chat interface utilizing WebSockets for real-time messaging.
  - **Backend**: WebSocket connections managed through FastAPI, using Redis for message queueing.
  - **Database**: Persistent chat history storage in PostgreSQL.

- **Data Flows**:
  - Users initiate chat through the app, establishing a WebSocket session.
  - Messages are passed through the backend, queued in Redis, and stored in PostgreSQL.
  - Couriers receive instant messaging via established WebSockets.

- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Ensure end-to-end encryption for security in messaging.
  - Implement user authentication/authorization for accessing the chat feature.

#### 3. Package Holding at Post Office
- **Components**:
  - **Frontend**: UI elements to set and display package hold preferences.
  - **Backend**: Endpoint to manage package hold requests and location preferences.
  - **Database**: Persist user preferences and notification data in PostgreSQL.

- **Data Flows**:
  - Users select 'Hold at Post Office' in delivery settings, triggering a request.
  - Backend processes and updates user choice, stores details of preferred post office.
  - Notifications are sent with confirmation and location details.

- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Integrate a postcode/location API to provide users with the nearest post office options.
  - Ensure data consistency between held packages status in the database and on user notification screens.

### Security and Scalability Considerations
- Secure data exchange with HTTPS and implement rate limiting on APIs.
- Utilize cloud services for autoscaling FastAPI backend under high load.
- Segment component instances to optimize load balancing and reliability.

### Acceptance Criteria
### Acceptance Criteria

#### 1. Real-time Package Tracking
- **Scenario: Displaying Real-Time Location**
  - Given that I am a logged-in user
  - And I have a delivery scheduled
  - When I open the "Tracking" section
  - Then I should see a map displaying the courier's current real-time location.

- **Scenario: Notification for Out for Delivery Status**
  - Given that my package is set for delivery today
  - When the courier marks the package status as "Out for Delivery"
  - Then I should receive a notification stating "Your package is out for delivery."

- **Scenario: Updating Delivery Progress**
  - Given that a courier is in transit with my package
  - When the courier moves toward my delivery address
  - Then the map on my app should update to reflect the courier's new location.

#### 2. Courier Communication
- **Scenario: Initiating Chat with Courier**
  - Given that I am viewing my ongoing delivery within the app
  - When I click on "Chat with Courier"
  - Then a chat window should open enabling text communication.

- **Scenario: Sending Special Instructions**
  - Given that I have opened a chat with my courier
  - When I enter specific delivery instructions and send the message
  - Then the courier should instantly receive the message in their chat window.

- **Scenario: Reschedule Delivery through Chat**
  - Given that I am chatting with my courier
  - When I request a delivery reschedule through the chat
  - Then I should receive a confirmation message acknowledging the new schedule.

#### 3. Package Holding at Post Office
- **Scenario: Selecting Hold at Post Office Option**
  - Given that I have a package en route
  - When I navigate to the delivery settings
  - And select 'Hold at Post Office'
  - Then I should be able to choose the nearest post office for pick-up.

- **Scenario: Receiving Hold Confirmation**
  - Given that I have selected 'Hold at Post Office' and confirmed my selection
  - When the backend processes my request
  - Then I should be instantly notified with the holding details and location.

- **Scenario: Collecting Package from Post Office**
  - Given that my package is on hold at a post office
  - When I visit the selected post office for collection
  - Then I should successfully retrieve my package upon verification.
